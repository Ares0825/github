{phang}
{cmd:github} {hline 2} installs Stata packages with a particular version (release) as well as their dependencies from 
 {browse "http://www.github.com/haghish/githubinstall":GitHub} 
 

{title:Syntax}

{p 8 16 2}
{cmd: github} [ {it:subcommand} ] {it:username}{bf:/}{it:repository} [{cmd:,} version(str) {it:replace force}]
{p_end}

{p 4 4 2}
The {bf:github} command takes several subcommands, which are:

{synoptset 20 tabbed}{...}
{synopthdr:subcommand}
{synoptline}
{synopt:{opt install}}installs the specified repository. The command should be 
followed by the {bf:username/repository}{p_end}
{synopt:{opt uninstall}}uninstalls a package{p_end}
{synopt:{opt query}}followed by {bf:username/repository}, it makes a table of 
all of the released versions of that package and allows you to install any version 
with a single click.{p_end}
{synoptline}
{p2colreset}{...}


{title:Description}

{p 4 4 2}
{bf:github} simplifies installing Stata packages from 
{browse "http://www.github.com/":GitHub} website. The package also allows installing 
older releaes of the package using the {bf:version()} option, a feature that 
improves reproducibility of analyses carried out by user-written packages. 


{title:Options}

{p 4 4 2}
The {bf:github} command also takes several options which are discussed below:

{* the new Stata help format of putting detail before generality}{...}
{synoptset 20 tabbed}{...}
{synopthdr}
{synoptline}
{syntab:Main}
{synopt:{opt v:ersion}}specifies a particular version (release tags){p_end}
{synopt:{opt replace}}specifies that the downloaded files replace existing files 
if any of the files already exists{p_end}
{synopt:{opt force}}specifies that the downloaded files replace existing files 
if any of the files already exists, even if Stata thinks all the files are the same.
force implies {bf:replace}.{p_end}
{synoptline}
{p2colreset}{...}



{title:Installing package dependencies}

{p 4 4 2}
Packages installed by {bf:github} command can also automatically install the 
package dependencies. 
For example, the {browse "https://github.com/haghish/MarkDoc":MarkDoc} package 
requires two other Stata packages which are 
{browse "https://github.com/haghish/weaver":Weaver} and
{browse "https://github.com/haghish/MarkDoc":Statax}. 
Usually, users have to install these packages manually after installing 
MarkDoc from GitHub or SSC. However, the {bf:github install} command will look 
for a file named {bf:dependency.do} in the repository and executes this file 
if it exists. 

{p 4 4 2}
The {bf:dependency.do} file will not be copied to the PLUS 
directory and is simply executed by Stata after installing the package. It can 
include a command for installing dependency packages using {bf:ssc}, 
{bf:net install}, or {bf:github install} commands. The latter is preferable because 
it also allows you to specify a particular version for the dependency packages. 

{p 4 4 2}
Note that the {bf:dependency.do} file will only be executed by {bf:github install} 
command and other installation commands such as {bf:net install} will not 
install the dependencies. 


{title:Example(s)}

    install the latest version of MarkDoc package from GitHub
        . github install haghish/markdoc, replace

    install MarkDoc version 3.8.1 from GitHub (older version)
        . github haghish/markdoc, replace version("3.8.1")

    list all of the available versions of the MarkDoc package
        . github query haghish/markdoc
